Discord Python Bot with multiple interactive features, including a music player with Spotify support, a tic-tac-toe game, and a Kirby artwork command. Some parts of the code and comments are in Portuguese.

To use the bot, you need to have a cookies.txt file (YouTube cookies) in the project directory, and FFmpeg must be available in the same directory for audio playback. The Discord token is hard-coded directly in the code.

The bot allows users to play music from YouTube and Spotify playlists or albums, pause and resume playback, skip songs, and manage a queue of songs. It also includes fun interactive commands such as sending Kirby artwork and playing a text-based tic-tac-toe game with friends directly in Discord.

This project is designed to be easily extendable. You can add your own commands or modify existing ones to customize the bot for your server. It serves as a practical example of integrating multiple APIs and Discord features using Python, including discord.py, yt-dlp, and spotipy.

The bot is ideal for hosting locally or on servers that support Python, allowing continuous operation while providing music and entertainment features to your Discord community.
